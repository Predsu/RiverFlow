RiverFlow is a native file manager with intent to replace Finder on any developer's Mac. It's highly customizable, lightweight and has dozens of Quality of Life improvements. It is a part of the Shrimple Project and as the whole project it's open-source and fully supported. It is available for any MacOS since Sonoma (14, due to usage of new Swift frameworks) and will also work on Intel-based Macs.

## Key features

<!-- * **Minimalist Interface** – The app runs as a MenuUI Agent, staying out of your Dock and occupying only a small footprint on your menu bar.
* **Multimedia Capable** – Fully supports high-resolution images as well as text up to 20,000 characters.
* **Burner Mode** – Allows the user to switch between JarvisClipThat and standard MacOS clipboard mode.
* **Autostart** - The app is starting along with the system letting you forget about starting it manually eacah time.
* **Global Shortcut** – Call the clipboard history anywhere and anytime using the `Shift + Option + V` shortcut. -->

## Installation & First Launch

<!-- Reviewers and users **do not need to compile this project from source**. Follow these steps to get the app running in seconds:

1. Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Predsu/JarvisClipThat/releases/latest) and download the `JarvisClipThat.dmg` file.
2. Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag **JarvisClipThat** into your **Applications** folder.
3. Open your Applications folder and launch the app.

### Overriding macOS Gatekeeper (Fixing the "Developer Cannot Be Verified" Error)

Because this app is an open-source project and is not distributed through the Mac App Store, macOS Gatekeeper might block the first launch with a warning. To safely bypass this:

1. Try to open the app normally. You'll get the warning about security.
2. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security.
3. Scroll to the bottom. You'll see a message that the app was blocked. Click Open Anyway.
4. Enter your password or use Touch ID.
5. Confirm Open.
6. The app will now launch successfully. -->

## Project Structure

<!-- The project is built using the standard native Swift application architecture, utilizing a lightweight configuration requiring no external setup files:

```sh
└── JarvisClipThat/
    ├── JarvisClipThatApp.swift   # Lifecycle, system menu bar items, and shortcuts
    └── ContentView.swift         # Clipboard storage manager logic and SwiftUI interface
``` -->

Requirements for Development
* Operating System: macOS 14+ (Sonoma)
* IDE/Compiler: Xcode 16.0+

## Privacy & Security
<!-- JarvisClipThat is built with absolute privacy in mind. Out of the box, it requires zero configuration and adheres to the following rules:
* RAM-Only Storage – The copy history is kept strictly in the volatile memory (RAM) of your machine.
* Zero Disk Footprint – It does not save your texts or images to any database, hard drive, plist, or cache file. Closing the app or restarting your Mac wipes the history completely.
	•	No Cloud Overhead – The app runs fully locally and has no network tracking, ensuring no data ever leaves your computer. -->

## About AI Usage
<!-- I'm a beginner in Swift programming and native MacOS apps thus the AI has been used for explaining how certain things work, small repetitive code completions and code review. About 10% of the whole repository code is written directly by AI. -->
